# Procedural-Programming(C)

 Some work, in C programming language, on the "Procedural Programming" course, at Department of Applied Informatics, University of Macedonia.

The files were created using "Code :: Blocks IDE" and I used "GNU Compiler for C / C ++".

Each folder (Week 1, Week 2, etc.) contains the tasks for each week.
Each folder (a4f1, a2f2, etc.) contains an exercise, with code file(.c), project file(.cbp), executable file(.exe) and text files(.txt) from which the program reads or writes(if any).
